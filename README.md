# ***Hiya!!***
## Welcome to my ***README!***

### A bit about me really quickly:
I'm Arco Nightshade, the CEO and Founder of Raptorbytes LLC (https://raptorbytes.org) which does tech stuff. I'm currently learning a few coding languages but I have 3 years of linux experience and have used the following distros: Mint, Arch, Arco, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Fedora, QubesOS, Debian, Void , Gentoo, NixOS, and Void, which basically covers majority of distros that there is, without some niche distros.
I like the video games *Helldivers 2* and *Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare*, and do 3D printing with my Bambu Labs P1S.
